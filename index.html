                in 1857. During his formation, he taught at Loyola College in Maryland and Boston College. He also studied at Woodstock College and was ordained a priest in 1874. Doonan became a professor at Georgetown before being named president in
                1882. He worked to offset the debt accrued during the construction of Healy Hall, and installed in front of the building two historic cannons that had been carried aboard Lord Baltimore's 1634 expeditionary voyage to Maryland. He also
                oversaw construction of a new building for the School of Medicine. After his presidency, Doonan continued teaching and engaging in pastoral work throughout the Northeastern United States. He died at Georgetown in 1911. <a href="">(Full article...)</a></p>
